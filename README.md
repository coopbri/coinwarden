Coinwarden is a cryptocurrency tracking application.

### Roadmap
Coinwarden is under active development, and is therefore minimal in its current state. There are several features planned, such as:
- Price history (graph + table)
- Price notification alerts
- "Favorites" screen with favorite cryptocurrencies
- Dark theme + theme toggle
- Data from all established cryptocurrencies (beyond top 100)

### License
Coinwarden is licensed under MIT, &copy; Brian Cooper. See <a href="LICENSE.md">LICENSE.md</a> for more information.
